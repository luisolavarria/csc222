1. What happens if you call the countdown function introduced in the Recursion section with an argument that is a negative number?

1. the Countdown Would keep subtracting one from n but because n is negative i would never reach 0. The countdown would keep printing numbers till it reaches the number -261961. then it displays a message that says "Segmentation fault".
